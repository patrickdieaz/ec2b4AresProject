Proposed Project: Engineering Equations Assistant
Features:
  - Equation Solver: Create functions to solve engineering equations, such as algebraic, differential, or integral equations.
  - Unit Conversion: Include the ability to convert units, a common need in engineering calculations. Provide options to input data in different units and convert them as necessary.
  - Plotting: Add a feature to visualize results using plots and graphs.
  - Results Display: Display the calculated results clearly and neatly, including units where applicable. MATLAB's built-in formatting functions can help implement this.
