Proposed Project: Solving Linear Differential Equations Using the Quadratic ODE Method
Features:
  - Equation Solver: Create a code that can solve for the roots of the quadratic equation as well as classify them according to the value of its discriminant.
  - Discriminant value has three kinds:
    - Positive
    - Zero
    - Negative
